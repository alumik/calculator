## Instructions

To use keyboard input, you need to **click on the answer area** to focus it. "KEYBOARD ON" will appear in the top right corner. The key mappings are as follows:

| Function | Key                         |
| -------- | --------------------------- |
| C/AC     | `c` / `C`                   |
| +/-      | `~` (shift+&#96;)           |
| %        | `%` (shift+5)               |
| +        | `+` / `NUM+`                |
| -        | `-` / `NUM-`                |
| ร        | `*` (shift+8) / `NUM*`      |
| รท        | `/` / `NUM/`                |
| =        | `Enter` / `NUM Enter` / `=` |
| 0~9      | `0`\~`9` / `NUM0`\~`NUM9`   |
| .        | `.` / `NUM.`                |

Pressing the clear key once clears the current step, and pressing it again clears everything.

## Notes

- For addressing precision issues in floating-point calculations, I have devised a method. It may not be the optimal solution.
- To prevent data loss, data display is allowed to exceed the boundaries of the display box.
